Some of my Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: Recommandation System for Netflix](https://github.com/KamilaKare/recommander-system/blob/master/recommander.ipynb)

* The dataset provided contains movie reviews given by Amazon customers. Reviews were given between May 1996 and July 2014.

* Analysis Task
*  Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Which movies have maximum views/ratings?
* What is the average rating for each movie? Define the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings.
* Define the top 5 movies with the least audience.
*  Recommendation Model: Some of the movies hadn’t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.

* Divide the data into training and test data
* Build a recommendation model on training data
* Make predictions on the test data

# Project 2: Deep Learning for Lending Club Loan Data Analysis 

* DESCRIPTION: Create a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data.

* Problem Statement:  

* For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you * have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features * that make this problem more challenging.

* Domain: Finance

* Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model. 

# [Project 3: Big data analysis with Pyspark](https://github.com/KamilaKare/Big-data-project/blob/main/project_Bigdata.ipynb)

* Domain Banking-Market-Analysis-

Background and Objective:

* Your client, a Portuguese banking institution, ran a marketing campaign to convince potential customers to invest in a bank term deposit scheme. The marketing campaigns were * * based on phone calls. Often, the same customer was contacted more than once through phone, in order to assess if they would want to subscribe to the bank term deposit or not. * You have to perform the marketing analysis of the data generated by this campaign.
