# Project 1: Recommandation System for Netflix

* The dataset provided contains movie reviews given by Amazon customers. Reviews were given between May 1996 and July 2014.

* Analysis Task
*  Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Which movies have maximum views/ratings?
* What is the average rating for each movie? Define the top 5 movies with the maximum ratings.
* Define the top 5 movies with the least audience.
*  Recommendation Model: Some of the movies hadn’t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.

* Divide the data into training and test data
* Build a recommendation model on training data
* Make predictions on the test data
